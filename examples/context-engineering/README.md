# Three-Phase Progressive Context Builder - Examples

This directory contains real-world examples of the Three-Phase Progressive Context Builder agent in action.

## Available Examples

### 1. Simple Todo App ✅
**File:** `example-1-simple-todo-app.md`

**Project:** Simple todo list web application
**Complexity:** Simple
**Time:** 62 minutes total
- Phase 1: 12 min
- Phase 2: 18 min
- Phase 3: 32 min

**Technologies:** React 18, Vite, CSS Modules, localStorage

**What It Demonstrates:**
- Complete three-phase workflow for simple project
- Progressive context accumulation
- Quality validation gates (all passed with ≥0.95)
- Client-side application (no backend)
- Responsive design
- localStorage persistence

**Key Takeaways:**
- Even simple projects benefit from systematic approach
- Clear requirements (Phase 1) lead to better architecture (Phase 2)
- Complete implementation (Phase 3) in reasonable time
- Production-ready code with accessibility and responsiveness

## How to Use These Examples

### Learning the Workflow

1. **Study Phase 1:**
   - Note how vague ideas become specific requirements
   - See targeted question categories
   - Understand feature prioritization
   - Learn quality validation criteria

2. **Analyze Phase 2:**
   - See how Phase 1 scope informs architecture
   - Understand technology selection rationale
   - Learn component design patterns
   - Study visual diagram usage

3. **Review Phase 3:**
   - See how architecture becomes code
   - Note code quality and best practices
   - Understand testing approach
   - Learn documentation standards

### Applying to Your Projects

1. **Match Complexity:**
   - Simple project? Study Example 1
   - Medium project? Study Example 2 (when available)
   - Complex project? Study Example 3 (when available)

2. **Adapt Structure:**
   - Use similar Phase 1 questions
   - Apply architectural patterns from Phase 2
   - Follow code organization from Phase 3

3. **Set Expectations:**
   - Time estimates from examples
   - Quality thresholds demonstrated
   - Deliverable completeness shown

## Tips for Using Examples

### Do:
- ✅ Study the complete workflow (all 3 phases)
- ✅ Notice how each phase builds on previous
- ✅ Pay attention to quality validation gates
- ✅ Learn from technology selection rationale
- ✅ Adapt patterns to your project context

### Don't:
- ❌ Copy code blindly without understanding
- ❌ Skip Phase 1 and 2 to rush to code
- ❌ Ignore quality validation failures
- ❌ Use technology without understanding tradeoffs

### Best Practice:
For your project, follow the same systematic approach:
1. Execute Phase 1 thoroughly
2. Validate before proceeding to Phase 2
3. Design architecture carefully in Phase 2
4. Validate before proceeding to Phase 3
5. Implement with full context in Phase 3
6. Measure results against examples
